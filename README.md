# Clojure Maze Client

The application is built using Ionic React which is a web UI framework for React. It is built using the Ionic CLI tools and npm as a package manager. In order to run the development environment the Ionic CLI has to be installed. Then, run
```
npm install
```
in the root project directory to install the required npm modules. When that is finished, run
```
ionic serve
```
to start the development server. The server will be started on http://localhost:8100.

# Run the pre-built application
> For convenience, I have already produced a built version of the app under the /build folder.
To run this please see [build/README.md](./build/README.md)
