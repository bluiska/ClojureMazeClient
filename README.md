# Clojure Maze Client for the [ClojureMazesBackendServer](https://github.com/bluiska/ClojureMazesBackendServer)

The application is built using Ionic React which is a web UI framework for React. It is built using the Ionic CLI tools and npm as a package manager. In order to run the development environment the Ionic CLI has to be installed. Then, run
```
npm install
```
in the root project directory to install the required npm modules. When that is finished, run
```
ionic serve
```
to start the development server. The server will be started on http://localhost:8100.

##Note: that this application was a quick prototype and used Ionic for the already packaged libraries that came with it, having used Ionic for another project already. This application was developed very quickly and proper coding standards have not been followed.
